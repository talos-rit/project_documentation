# Project Methodology Plan

## Planned Activities and Artifacts

### 4 Phases
1. Planning
    - Prototype planning
    - Prototype plan
    - Decide on new metrics to add
2. Risk Analysis
    - Risk analysis meetings
    - Risk register (as roadmap for research)
    - Sub-team research meetings
3. Engineering
    - Team updates and sub-team meetings
    - Update old and create new diagrams and documentation
4. Evaluation
    - Retrospective meeting
    - Collect and analyze metrics for this past prototype
    - Overal prototype evaulation (self-grade on process)

## Roles - How they interface with your methodology
- Sub-team leads (both for research and engineering)
- Group meeting leaders (to keep things on track)

## Standards and Quality Practices - How will testing, deployment verification, etc. work?
- Engineering and testing will be time-boxed. If integration of new features is not completed in the  time-frame, cut the scope of the prototype down to what works and end the sprint. 
- Especially risky reserach will be also time-boxed. 
- Sub-team unit-testing happens in its own time-box. 
- Full-team integration testing happens in its own time-box. 

## Tools - What tools will help with your chosen methodology?
- 

## Metrics and Measurements - Another element of the project plan that will affect and be affected by this one.
