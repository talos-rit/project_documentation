[J Russ (RIT Student)] 16:58:34
So it's 8 hours Saturday, 8 hours Sunday. I had to be there at 8 AM both days.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 16:58:40
So, I got no extra sleep this weekend. That was your weekend?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 16:58:44
That was my entire weekend, yeah. Oh, and then we watched the… oh, and then we did something stupid.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 16:58:49
That's stupid, it's actually kind of fun on Saturday night, but… Do we know if this thing works? I literally grabbed it out of the e-waste, I couldn't find a paracord for it, so…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 16:58:58
I have 400 extra power cards at home, if we really need one. Yeah. Is there… there's probably one around here for it.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 16:59:05
Maybe? It's just a usually PC power cord. If you have a hundred of them, because I got them for different parts, and they weren't long enough. Oh, they did lock it! No way! Wasn't the key, like, up here. Shit.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 16:59:17
He's good. I should have taken a picture of the pee.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 16:59:24
Yeah! 3d print a new one, yeah. I'm just not, uh… Is there anything on the top of that?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 16:59:34
No fees. Sorry, definitely a standard key, so if you have a little bit of, like, earrings, you can get into it. Nah, it's not standard, that's a Yale key, it's…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 16:59:42
Yeah, it's a 350 goal. Advanced, that's not the right case. Maybe Keg has already not so open. There we go.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 16:59:52
Just saying, Corden. Alright, using those at the same time, aren't we?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 16:59:57
Probably not. You know, we don't even need the talent robot today, probably, right? Not a chance.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:00:03
So, actually, I was wondering… Oh… Oh, that's… this is kind of a physical thing?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:00:11
But is it because this is so not rigid that this shakes and gets e-stopped?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:00:16
Or is it simply the… the motion of the robot itself. Why don't we solve our platforming problem? Boeing quite a bit.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:00:26
I didn't think of that. So… We could make a base for it.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:00:31
Obviously, you want a shelf, but if we reinforce this somehow, it might… Yeah.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:00:37
Sure. Even just, like, put a block under it right underneath the report. You have the extra piece of pilot on the club room floor that I want to get rid of?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:00:44
Yeah, well… I have so much extra… Just to recycle.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:00:48
I don't want it. I want to throw it out. Well… why not recycle it? I just threw away a bunch of cardboard in the room earlier today, because I got sick and tired of all the junk in there.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:00:59
So that's, uh, that's a material thing, so unless we can find scrap, it'll have to be purchased, but I'm sure we can find scraps for that. We can do.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:01:07
Ricky! I wasn't joking at that piece of plywood, Ricky. Wow. True rename ones.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:01:14
Oh, to Ricky? You mean the brick, or one of the robots? One of the robots.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:01:21
Duct tape this to it. Uh-huh. The outcast, we saw neither of the messages I sent to him.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:01:31
Hurus said, not gonna be early? And by that, I mean he was gonna be late, right? Yeah, that's what I mean.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:01:41
Okay. Like, how late? Why are we doing this?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:01:48
Like I said, horses to come here. Sorry, I'm looking at something else. Suiting what?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:01:53
Okay, so I'm definitely talking about something else, but… Yeah, I… more crap that I get to go deal with after this. Anyway.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:02:02
So, what's the agenda for today? I think we just come up with a foreup, that's fine. 4 up.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:02:06
What does that blocker repo… Well, we didn't have repo access, that was the block. Okay, so… I was just saying, what Malikowsky gave us repos. Supposedly. I'm gonna go on and check now. I haven't checked yet.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:02:18
We've watched him do it, so… should be… Hey, he's a wizard.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:02:24
Oh, let's go. Oh, one of the frats want to rent, like, 8 tents from us now. Which frat?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:02:33
It matters. Uh, I can tell you if I go to thinbox. Although, let me pull up the GitHub first.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:02:41
It does matter, it's true. What's the fucking… teak?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:02:46
Yeah. What about tape? Nobody likes tea. Some of the allegations?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:02:52
I don't have any personal opinions on anything, I've just heard that Teak is super status, they were… And that's what I've heard. No, they're nowhere near as famous. I don't even… Okay, so I'll have to go… well, did everyone get the invite? I'm not gonna…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:03:08
I see… I'm still not on the people. I don't know where an invites.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:03:14
Service. I am in the people now, but I can't add people to the people. How did you… where did the invite show up? I just went to the palace organization page, and it said, you got invited from.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:03:26
I love going on right now. Like, if I go to the overview page.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:03:27
Shit, I drank Thursday. There you go. Oh my god. The person not having classified. I mean, I smoke weed. Let me decline that real quick. I've done no work on Monday for Sunday. I have, like, 2 minutes.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:03:39
Yeah, I mean, we haven't… So, here's the fun part, at least.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:03:43
I have, yeah. I had a group assignments, I did nothing on it.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:03:48
Yeah, I… I got a message from one of our teams. Does that mean we have access to the repos, the question? I just said, shit. Well, I'll do some work on this. Sometimes being on the project… Unless there was a project doesn't necessarily give you… Oh, yeah.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:04:05
Yeah, it's hard to get on it. Which I'm fine with, but, like, they're starting early and then finish early? Yeah.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:04:11
They just don't leave. I just want to make sure we have the right access and everything. Yeah, I can screw around with the actual board.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:04:18
As long as I don't get… It looks like we're getting period balance, yeah.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:04:21
Don't know. That's fair. I want to know how they fit 6 people in this room.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:04:28
I mean, theoretically, you just have, like… 3 and 3, but I mean, shoulder to shoulder, it would… It'd be pretty nice. It would be pretty romantic.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:04:37
The other thing you can do is… so, now that we have their.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:04:41
Email, we can go in and obviously we'll… Oh, we got that too? Uh, yeah, because they were on the GitHub, we probably… Oh, yeah, yeah.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:04:47
We could have figured that out earlier, but… That's true. We also have to say… you know.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:04:55
Not just hit them up out of the blue. Can we get… should we get the 4-up going? I mean, if that's the only thing we got. Yeah, let's do it. Get it out of the way. Do I have to hear it again here?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:05:05
We could start with that, and then we're recording, Eric. Yeah, I'm recording. Sweet, just remember what we have with him, and then… Brilliant. Do you want to draft the… the email? Or do the forum? I can do either. We continue using their documentation.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:05:23
Uh, we should definitely separate off our documentation from theirs in some… Let's move, so let's do this. I think this is a good idea. There's already a folder in there for 4ups, you said?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:05:34
In the project docs, there's a, uh, template. Where? That's a great question. It is… I think under project…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:05:42
Pms? Yeah, four of us.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:05:45
So, here's what I would do. Is take everything from PM.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:05:52
Throw it into a 2024. Folder. Yeah. And then, just in the PM folder, because the rest of it, I think, is globally.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:05:59
Yeah, just… Makes sense. But I think listed in the PM folder… We'll create a 2020-something folder, move all of it in there, and then what we can do is we can… We can use a prototype, but then we'll use our own folder and stuff.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:06:12
I think someone want to do that, or…? Yeah, I'm working on that already.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:06:17
I'll work on the email if you would like. The day of their meeting notes in there.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:06:28
I love writing emails. It feels like all I do is… This is…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:06:35
I gotta do the fucking… You mean work? Yeah.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:06:40
I mean, literally, emailing at this point feels like all I do. I still have to reply to another email.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:06:46
After this, I think I want to do consulting. I don't want to do so, actually.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:06:51
So, writing emails? Yeah, pretty much. Don't you love writing emails? Love it. It's my favorite thing to do.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:06:57
Still not. Well, you know? Not terrible, yeah. Oh, no, I loved it, yeah. I do it so many. I had… how many have I sent?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:07:07
I sent one yester… oh, jeez, I sent… 2 yesterday. Three yesterday.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:07:14
Three emails in one day? That's insane. Well, one was because somebody saw a poster for our club and wanted us to do an RIT365 do session.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:07:25
I had to go meet with her another time. And then, to use this robot, do we even need all the…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:07:32
Motor's working. Why? What do you mean by that?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:07:37
I don't think there are any, uh… As far as developing drivers go, you can figure out if some of it works just by… you know, you test the motors that work, and that's it.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:07:47
Yeah. Oh, sorry, who was… ultimately, we want to get the whole robot before. Oh, yeah, of course.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:07:54
So that can happen in semi-parallel, right? Yeah. That shows, you know, starting to get at. Gotcha, gotcha. Uh, it was, in fact…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:08:03
18… or, no. 5 emails.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:08:10
Uh, anyway.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:08:18
East, okay, and this is… let's follow their formatting. 2024… 2020? This is 2025, 9, 9…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:08:27
I'm gonna see what floor up. You get a lot of the forums, yeah.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:08:33
Especially when they stop doing it.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:08:40
Ksf7880. Alright. For a time. Progress.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:08:46
What progress have we made? We understand the scope. Repo access. Repo access. We unblocked the repo access.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:08:52
Should not be power, theoretically. Did you verify that? Yeah, it looks like we have right access.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:08:58
You just gotta accept during that. We got repo access. We've determined our major goals. Yes. Yeah.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:09:04
Someone clarified the scope. We got eaten ones, right?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:09:11
Yeah, and I'm currently writing an email for her right now, so we can just say, contact Google team, maybe? Yeah, because it'll be done by tomorrow. Yeah, or we should put that in plans.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:09:21
That's a good idea for plans. Gotta have something there. Yeah.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:09:26
Well, we can put the plans meet with the team. Yes. I think sending the email will be done by the time before I pick this. Yeah, honestly. I will have it done by tonight, if I'm gonna play with it at this meeting.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:09:35
Uh, what are the protocols that we made? Um… Named Robots. Yes.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:09:41
That's a big one. Yeah, we named the robots. Oh, geez.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:09:45
Robots and team name. Yep. Hello, hello, hello! Welcome to our… what have we got? Cora? Yeah. We're going through progress right now. What have we accomplished so far? We now have repo access as of… Oh, really? Oh, that's good. As of probably 10 minutes ago. Like, all of us? Yeah. Okay. You have to accept the invite into the organization, but…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:10:06
Sounds good. No, he wouldn't reply to my email, or my Slack message. We walked into his office 5 minutes ago.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:10:15
Right, and he was just there, chillin'. I like that. His office door was open, so he couldn't really ignore us.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:10:23
That's my philosophy. Your office door is open. You can't hide anymore. Tap them on the shoulder.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:10:31
That's why I did not receive anything. Well, I appreciate that's why he doesn't, I think he has… Yeah, you have to, like, go to the organization.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:10:39
Oh, right. I mean, that's what I do at Chelsea Golf, it's, too. I would just, like, walk up with absolutely no prior notice, and… Yeah, although she doesn't leave her office this much anymore, because she's busier. I have the advisor's lucky he's not here.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:10:55
Yeah. If I did on that other side. But I know, uh, bullets are stars in Markdown, right? Stars, yeah. Star space. Or you can do dash space. Dash space. I've done star space, too, they won't work. Interesting.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:11:09
That's what I do. Louis… I just, I only have the flash so that I can do the multi-factor authentication with it.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:11:19
But that's a work on there. Yeah, but it's also useful for other stuff every once in a while, I don't know.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:11:27
Wait, how do I even… how is this even an invite? Oh, we got a monitor.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:11:33
Moses are. Sort of that, oh god. What do you want?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:11:40
I mean, it was e-waste. We haven't tested it fully.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:11:48
It powers on, though, so… HDMI is the big part. Anybody get an issue, Matt? Do you want micro HCM on it? Because I know Raspberry Pi only has a micro…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:11:59
Uh, yeah, that's the next step after we make sure the monitor works. Oh, yeah, definitely on the… that would be awesome if we had… yeah.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:12:07
I got a micro HDMI at home. I have one at home, too, because I have a Pi. I have two of them, but… All right, risks. Any other progress, too?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:12:17
Now, I haven't really done much. Uh, I think a risk may be… the scope. I know that they had told… I don't know Scope Creek, but they had mentioned they know what a good.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:12:28
Well-provisioned scope is, so… Yeah. I think, right, yeah, risk is definitely the current scope.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:12:34
Is our Scope 2 ambitious? Again, we'll figure that out as we learn, but we're not ambitious enough.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:12:40
What's the word? What's the word for that? Is your Discord profile picture just, like, a blank? Yeah, it's the gray that they used to be. Um… Every time I look at it, I think it's not loaded. I know!

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:12:53
I hate it. It's just… it's certainly cool. Opposite of ambitious. Where's fucking AI when I need it?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:13:04
Offset of ambitious. It's faster.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:13:10
Unambitious. Oh. Wow. Lazy. That got us all.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:13:19
I have Wi-Fi access, right? Yes, it's on that. I don't know how easy it's going to be to… actually… Other risks… Oh, I can definitely connect it to Wi-Fi. The other thing is, I probably have… Oh, I'm pretty sure the SSE TV is still on my TV Wi-Fi.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:13:34
I have no idea. One day we spent, like, a half an hour trying to get the TV inside of the SV, we have a wall connected to the Wi-Fi.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:13:41
Yeah, because you're trying to play YouTube on the Smart TV? Under… wrists, I kind of want to put… Hey, this sounds fair. Like, if we can get Blue King and I… Yeah! I could totally see it happening, that we just, like, spend the entire…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:13:54
Again, I think that's… I think that's scope risk, I think that's what that is. Yeah, well, that's fair.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:14:01
Well, I mean, it's a sub… Yeah, it's a… Yeah, I think that's funny to go on there. What? There's a dead bug on this one. Oh, yummy.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:14:11
Oh, we need a working camera. Wait, you said that one's good?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:14:17
This one? I don't know. We need two warehouse. Yeah. That one should be. It says it might be bad, but…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:14:24
Okay, well, regardless of if we have them or not, we need to either verify that we have them or get.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:14:32
Uh, so we… So we do need to integrate accounts, and then… Oh, for here at 5, too.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:14:39
Verify, uh, functionality of… I have a USB-C cable on me, so I can't test this one, but I… I don't know.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:14:47
Actually, I do, I'm just stupid. Robots… we kind of verified the functionality there, so I can say we… Yeah, maybe we put that under… Where am I gonna plug that into?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:14:59
I don't know. I need somewhere to, like, plug it in, but it's back there.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:15:06
Or… There you go. What's the model number for the gray one? It's the EV5. Er5? Or ER5. So that's always a good… ERV or ER5? Erv. Where?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:15:20
Oh! Yeah, we got blue and oak. Yeah, um… Oh, it works? Uh, sort of.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:15:27
I don't know. I don't know, red blinky light seems… Doesn't seem promising. Yeah.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:15:36
Sounds… Is it, like, are you able to connect to it in your laptop? Great question. Incomplete firmware update. So we have to perform a manual firmware update to fix it.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:15:45
Oh, it isn't as hard as it sounds, I take it. Yeah, for what? It does? Yeah.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:15:53
Listen to what, Reza. Oh. I'm from.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:16:01
What the fuck do you have? I said I have the most weird shit in here that annoying about it. Trust me, I think it's not as fun as that. No. Wait, what did you have?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:16:12
Oh, random cat 6? Yeah. Okay.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:16:17
The internet down. I have Ethernet download. Oh, I got that.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:16:27
We got a twin sandwich.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:16:32
That sounds good. Tune is good. The one… the one bag that I'm sure Hedge was wearing and crap in it was my hiking bag. I'm really throwing anything… anybody else? Progress, risks, plans, or needs? Do we have any other plans?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:16:46
Before we eat our dog. Yeah. Oh, that'll do it.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:16:50
What? It's not bad. Oh!

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:16:55
Gopro motors are expensive, aren't they? What is that, a Hero 5? You know, if we can power it.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:17:02
What? Do we need a battery? I think we can just plug it in when we need a battery.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:17:06
Potentially, no, but is it actually doing anything right now? No, it's not at the bottom. No, so we need to… maybe we'll do that after we get the 4, but I get a senior. That's a plan, is… Well, no, that's kind of in the plan, verify equipment functionality.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:17:24
Specifically… Oh, they had a rationale for why they love it.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:17:27
The webcam down. I wish they wrote it down, at least. Yeah.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:17:31
So, easy, cheap… yeah, exactly, I think those are the biggest… GoPros, right? Or a webcam?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:17:38
You don't need, like, no pros aren't, like, one of these. Yeah, you're talking about it, like, the webcam meets the needs of the application.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:17:43
Yeah. Well, it'd be nice if they said that. Fair enough.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:17:51
Um… we only have one need. Are there any other needs?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:17:56
Blocking tasks… Needs can be anything, right? Yeah.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:18:02
Million books. An A. An A. I think Kaiser would like that, yeah.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:18:09
Um… What's after winged stripper polling?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:18:16
Like, how nicely do you think we'd have to ask? I think, uh, we'd have to expose somebody's.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:18:24
Affair for them to… Yeah. …get blackmailed into doing that. Once after we clarify the scope with the previous team, then we start planning the…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:18:36
Roles. Uh… land and rolls…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:18:41
And responsibilities, oh, that's a long word. And metrics, tasks.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:18:48
Determine… project metrics, divvy out.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:18:53
Well, my God, I love writing emails. Feels like my job. Oh, I feel like I've remembered something midweek that I don't remember now.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:19:02
That was concerning this.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:19:08
Are you getting the pipe? Oh, no, you're just plugging it into Ethernet.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:19:13
We don't have a… we don't have a mini HDMI, do we? No. I'll have to bring one in. What do we need?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:19:18
To plug the pie into the library. So we can, I don't know, see it if we wanted to. Have an easy terminal.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:19:23
They don't have to be worried about mouse. I have a keyboard lying around.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:19:28
I have a… oh, it might be… I was gonna say, I have a dumpster Fire keyboard sitting on the floor. What is the other startup tasks?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:19:39
Yeah, no, it's like popular keyboard they used to use for inventory. Pretty sure it's a PS2 keyboard. It's also sitting on the floor, collecting dust at the moment. What else do you have been there?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:19:52
Uh, my screwdrivers. It just keeps getting more interesting.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:19:57
I don't know how to move around. Look, if I… if I had my, like.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:20:01
You… all that stuff's in my house. Like, I have… If you want to see what's in my room, that's where it goes crazy. I have an entire ratcheting screwdriver set.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:20:11
Oh, I have a spackle knife, and… SC bronze axe. Oh, I had lockpicks in there, they're not legal and everything. Kaiser still hasn't… I bought mine in Ohio, and I brought them here. Well, you don't bring them everywhere you go?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:20:27
No, I don't. Not anymore. No, it's one of those crimes of, like, then I started getting pulled over, and… Uh… I don't. You don't speak at all. How the fuck do you not speed? Okay, make the guy, like, 2 miles an hour, but… Dogs. You are lying through your teeth right now. Did I wave early!

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:20:49
But, like, why? Because I can tap. Also, I don't need another speaking taker, because I've had two.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:20:57
Oh, me too! Well, maybe not. I just paid my other one.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:21:00
My other cost me a few hundred dollars. So the one in New York that I got, like.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:21:05
Two years ago, I think? That was $2.47, but I didn't get punts.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:21:11
Yeah. Because you're not from New York. Well, I just… I had to argue that. Yeah, they let me argue, but I don't think New York points carry over to Massachusetts, but do they?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:21:22
They don't carry over to Ohio. Problem is, both my tickets have been in New York, so they count New York points.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:21:27
So I had to fight both ends. Oh, and then the other one, I just paid $1.50.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:21:31
So not too bad, but mine was… mine was… I had to fight them down. My insurance went up.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:21:37
Ever, and I'm not getting those student tickets. Yeah, the way Massachusetts works is… you can get an unlimited number of points. This is just your insurance. Oh, no, New York, when you get to your… Oh, you can't see any license, yeah. My dad had to take a class because we got too many speeding tickets in Europe. You wonder why? I don't speed anymore!

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:21:56
I don't have to, because I don't… I got it. Yes, you did. I'm gonna make another, uh, thing inside of meeting notes, so that we can post our own meeting notes.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:22:05
I mean, 2024 versions. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:22:11
I'll do a million people. You… yeah, no wonder you're back. It looked like a giant bomb. Yeah, and it's half empty, actually.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:22:18
Like, what is this accomplishment? Actually, yeah, it's… I got caught by, uh… Oh, it's a little, uh… Yeah, they once, because I just had too many hands. Singing wobbobber. You know? Like, what the fuck? Oh, what's a Who's it? Why is this not…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:22:33
Maybe you have spit on it in your mouth. How are you?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:22:43
Alright, eyes on.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:22:49
Uh, can somebody transfer the… I think, um, Teppa.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:22:56
The meeting minutes from last week. To the GitHub. Actually, it might be worth just all getting all the repos set up right now, if we have nothing else to do. Yeah.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:23:05
But what do you mean by meaning? Like, the AI chat thing? Oh, transferring that to the GitHub.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:23:14
Even with exporting the document.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:23:22
Oh, do you actually plug into USB… See this time? Because that's at the other table was… for this USB-C cable, I think. That was how it was being powered before, and this is also the serial monitor. Of course. Should I branch the project documentation? You can actually get a terminal on the Pi.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:23:39
Oh, okay. That's how I was accessing it the other day.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:23:41
I don't know if I can SSH into it. Should I bring the IP address? How? I just TCP'd done.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:23:48
Oh, that's why, because you're plugging the… are you plugged the Ethernet directly, too? Yeah.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:23:53
I have to figure that out. They ain't do a brain. They did a branch.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:23:58
There's 4 branches, but there's only one listed? The problem is, it doesn't auto-de… it doesn't DHCP, so it has to get an idea. Yes, I internet share.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:24:06
72… oh, God. They didn't merge all their shit. What? I have to connect to the guest Wi-Fi, and then share it. If we get connected, if you want to connect it to the Wi-Fi, I can just, I mean, either you or I can just stick it under our other devices. Honestly, yeah, probably… And then you can set it up with a certain subdomain, so you can just access it anywhere. What did you say the account was on this guy?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:24:28
Uh, it's in the resources channel, I forget what it was already.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:24:32
Dude, I'm gonna… I'm gonna fucking push the master. On the pie? Dude, it's just notes.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:24:39
What buzzword? Wait, you're talking to me? It thinks the entire blog of people talking is just Jay. Well, yeah, that's because it all came from my computer.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:24:48
I don't… I'm kind of glad it doesn't detect people's voices. Jay's just been talking to himself sometimes. Yeah, this entire… you guys are… I'm schizophrenic.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:25:00
Someone in there? Uh, yeah, that's what I'm on right now. Oh, you're on it? Oh, cool.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:25:06
4 up, and…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:25:11
I think he does this. Was SSH enabled?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:25:15
I don't know, I never anticipated into it. Hey, you just asked access to the cereal, right? Yep, I mean, I can enable SSH if you…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:25:25
Yeah, just, that'll probably be a lot easier. Gotta go into your cereal? It'll probably exist.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:25:30
Just refusing 4.93. I was just screening it, is how I was going into it, and then running a console. I forgot it has the screen command.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:25:37
I can't remember what blog rate it was, but… I don't have a fucking USB… I can tell you what blog rate it was if you gave me, like, 2 seconds.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:25:51
It was, in fact, 115200 was the baud rate that I was using. Fine, got it.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:26:03
Let's see what's going on? Oh, you're gonna have to use, like, a year or a couple tool or something, I don't know what you used for that, but… That's funny.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:26:10
I'm good. What's the boardroom? 115-200?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:26:14
Really nice if this would do something. I wonder how they broke it. What model is it?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:26:21
A5? Here are 5.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:26:27
Yeah, it wasn't even coming up. That's anything I might get in.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:26:37
Actually… I've actually done cereal.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:26:41
Room? No? Yeah. Alma has just been in this stage. Even when we… when you said 340?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:26:47
Yeah. Oh! Everything? I've said the whole thing. No, you're right.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:26:56
Everything? Okay, but honey. Just, when you flash your advice, it's over cereal. Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah. But even when you're doing with CRO console stuff, too, and at least Kaider when I took it with a…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:27:10
I think we did it, uh, Bruce's class, too. I'm gonna fuckin' AI search this, make sure it's good. Hero 5.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:27:17
It says it on the site. Oh, it does? Am I blind? Yeah, it said on the side. Holy shit, I'm blind!

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:27:26
Dude, I don't know, this is… oh, there we go. Fast reading.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:27:31
Mess on the virus on me. Dude, it's my… it's my protection, alright?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:27:38
We'll protect it without it.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:27:44
Well, I get the paid version for free, so… Really? Mm-hmm. Wow. A family plan.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:27:55
I'm sorry. Yup.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:28:03
I don't know what I expected, but it's not coming up easily.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:28:09
Oh, that's tricky. A hard reset, you have to have a battery for a hard reset.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:28:16
Perform hard reset by holding the shutter button for at least 10 seconds, and then connected charger.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:28:21
To check if the red light appears. You guys want to try and make it think it's connected to a battery?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:28:28
I could probably find enough paper clips. We have one resisted, too. Four terminals, so…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:28:37
One of them. Take your poison. Alrighty, I'm gonna send you guys the draft of the email, you can let me know if you like it or not.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:28:45
It's really, and we'll try. You got that USB-C still? Or is that just from your… Thank you.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:28:53
See if I can just… So I take it nobody's gonna read the draft, and I'll just send it as it is? We'll read it? Where is it?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:29:02
The email to the… Wait! Huh, it's trying to connect! Huh? Amba A9S to this Mac. What the fuck?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:29:10
Doesn't look… it doesn't look here. As the team is using a Mac, I didn't even realize that.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:29:16
Oh, no shit. That's good. Yeah. Wow, I've never been in a group with this many people using that. I guess I'm the outlier.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:29:26
I'm also using Windows. You might be the only person… wait, he's on… That's 2v3. Yeah, you might be the only person using Windows. Yeah. I'm using Linux.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:29:35
Wait, it said I wanted to connect, but now I can't find it. How are you? Is it a Dell machine using Linux?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:29:41
Yeah, Dell. Well, I reboot… I have a dual-boot Windows and Linux on it. Yeah.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:29:47
She's here by driving it. Because I replaced it, because I have a 1TB drive, and then I wanted more storage. You're so cool. Should we sign this as the whole team?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:29:56
Yes. I would say so. It's the one change.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:30:02
Call us, whatever. Nah, not actually, but, you know.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:30:07
You can come up with a fun name. Didn't we come up with them?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:30:15
Well, I'm going to repaste it again, then, because I want to make sure I don't spell your names wrong.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:30:20
Because I definitely… Honestly, you should misspelled one of our names. Maybe I should miss the next one's stuff. Yeah? Let me disconnect you today, maybe that'll help.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:30:32
Uh, Ryan, did you connect over seriously before? Oh! Okay, what's the login?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:30:40
That's in resources. Bye. That's… I think…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:30:46
And then, uh… I got it. I thought.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:30:53
Hi, and then Palo Sound team.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:30:58
Okay, I'm in. Okay, you want to check it to make sure I didn't spell any of your name wrong?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:31:05
Are any of you guys not colorblind? Yes? You want to tell me what… What do you mean? Oh, I'm horribly colored. I can't tell the Mr. Colors, I don't know what they are. No one can.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:31:18
What do you mean? Brown, black, orange, gold? Yeah, what? So, like, Google that.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:31:25
I don't know the numbers. Brown black. I think brown is one. Did I spell anyone's name wrong? Orange would be… I think 10?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:31:33
Before I send this email out? Brown, black, orange cold. Where are you putting it? Discord? Generally, yeah.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:31:38
That's the… that's the… you got my name. Yeah, that's good.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:31:42
I think it's all dry as an options. I spelled my own thing wrong. Yeah, dude. Wow. Unable, disable.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:31:51
I think I got you on that, Seth? Oh, I forgot the U.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:31:57
What are you talking about in Ryan? Did I spelled both your names right? I don't think I spelled your last name right, hold on.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:32:05
Cool. Oh. I spelled your last to cancel that. My last name? No, Kai.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:32:10
Just check. How do I check the status? I'll switch it up real quick.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:32:18
Brush buttons. Well, we're gonna assume it's correct, so I'm just gonna shoot off it. How many bands are in there? Actually, no, here's what I'm gonna do.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:32:30
Sweet, okay. I think gold is the plus or minus, whatever. Active. So, I'm gonna shoot this off tomorrow morning, I'm gonna schedule it, cause…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:32:38
Nobody ever… nobody looks at an email if they look at it now.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:32:44
I never heard that. Oh, right-o. I scheduled it, it went over… I do that because nobody looks at email at 5.30 at night. I've learned that the hard way. Yeah, they'll see it on their phone, and then swipe. And then they'll forget about it and never look at it.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:32:59
I do that all the time. So I… yeah, I like… Gmail, you used to have a scheduler. Can they get rid of it? Oh, they had one, but they get used to it.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:33:07
Uh, well, when I started using you. Oh, shit, okay. I have content, or IP config? Yeah.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:33:17
He wrote 10. I want Hero 5. You know, GoPro's going out of business?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:33:22
Yeah. Did you get it to work, or do you…? Well, I got it to say it was connecting, but then I didn't do anything. I couldn't find it as a device.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:33:30
Yeah, that's the issue. Mine never came up. Let me see… So did we get a 4-up, but how are we? Yes, 4-up is good on the GitHub, if you want to check that out. Okay, I just got bumped with getting the wrong demos the entire time. One day I'll stop running emails, one day I'll be done.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:33:47
No, you'll never be down. No, I will. One day we're… Actually, no, this is why we need to return to office, Bush.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:33:54
No worries now. We're… all meetings are in person now. Now, at work, I'd send it to Teams people rather than…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:34:01
I would, too. Oh, shit, that… Are you gonna do double-enter?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:34:07
So, and for supply chain stuff, this was our email suppliers, and then… So, what should we do for us? So, I told you, we got bothered to do a due cycle for RT365.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:34:18
The class that everyone loves. What's a 2-cycle? It's one of the… so, remember 365, you, like, for some of the weeks, you'd either have… Plan, due… Yeah, reflect, and you'd have to, like, go somewhere… So now they're apparently… I didn't remember it. Parts of the dew cycle. I don't know, that's kinda cool.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:34:40
So, of course, she sent us one email, but I kind of ignored it because it was over the summer, and I didn't feel like replying.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:34:46
And it was a little late. They're probably desperate for… And then, no, they're actually two more left. Um, the only two left.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:34:52
And then, she was like, oh, I saw only a poster with the SAU, so she emailed us.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:34:58
So you're gonna do it? If we find… I told her that we would look into it. If you don't want to do it, just don't do it. Yeah, just say no. Well, it wasn't that I didn't want to do it. I asked our e-board if they wanted to do it, and they all seemed interested, so… Okay. I'll have one of them.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:35:13
I wouldn't mind doing it if we come up with something fun, to be fair.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:35:17
Yeah. I was just busy at the… Yeah, this is fun.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:35:22
I was thinking of doing, like, okay, here's this… because we had something here, right? Here's this backdang backpack, and repack it good, because just… and put the most absurd in.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:35:32
Repack it good. Actually, you should just put them to work, just make them do shit in your closet that, like, don't feel like doing.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:35:39
Now, because I have so many… No, no, no. I think now that I have… right now that I have a lot of time between classes, I think what I might just do is just…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:35:48
Sit there on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and just, like, just go sit in the closet? No, I'll just not sit there, but, like.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:35:55
Clean stuff up, because, like, he definitely would have just been sitting there at the other time.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:36:00
And of course, I did have to whip up my computer while I was in there, because somebody decided to.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:36:05
Throw a curveball at me. There's not very specific then. Now, this is the frat. Alright, I give up.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:36:13
Yeah, wait, which frat is it? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you want me to tell you?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:36:16
It's, uh… Sigma Alpha Moo Fraternity. Thank you. Alpha Moon. They're fun.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:36:25
Are they? You should do them. Are we going to get our gear back in one piece? Yes.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:36:30
They'll give you your feedback. By the next weekend. They're pretty good about that.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:36:39
Depends on who reach out to, though. Aiden? I assume? I gotta get there. Last name and positionous.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:36:46
Uh, Brotherhood Chair. Oh, yeah, no, you should do that. They're on the more responsible side.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:36:59
What's the event? Oh, actually on Windows. Mmm, crying. Yeah, I have to reboot my whole computer now.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:37:07
Variously on Mondays? Because it says that I have to be on Windows 35. I just do it?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:37:12
I'm already on my boots. I could be on Windows in, like, 2 seconds, too.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:37:16
Up to you. I already… I already started. It was never ongoing at this point for him.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:37:24
He's excited. I'm not, because I'm sure there's going to be 5 million updates as soon as I turn it on.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:37:29
Yeah, he was so excited about those 5 million updates, though. Yeah. Yeah, you can tell. We can see it in his eyes.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:37:35
We've got that mischievous grin on. Oh, and the sound turns on, like… Yeah, the sound's getting to them, man. Yup!

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:37:42
Yeah, Ryan, don't get emotional. Hey, girl's getting excited.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:37:49
Are you sure is all this is gonna be in our meeting notes? I wonder how the AI is going to summarize this. Everyone's gonna know Ryan.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:37:58
Ryan gets excited over Windows updates. I think we should repeat that again, just for the… so the AI thinks… Ryan gets excited. Ryan gets very excited over Windows updates.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:38:10
This is a very important… Very important. This needs to be in the notes.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:38:16
Make sure we mention it as good times as possible. Oh, let me have a microSD card.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:38:24
I going. Do you really? I got, like, 4.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:38:28
Between their five of those. Random thing we could possibly need. They're… it's the perfect USB drive. It's tiny.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:38:36
Uh, you can buy them for cheap. I mean, yeah, you don't really need fast speeds for anything other than, like, video. No, this is a brand new one.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:38:47
Okay. You buy them from Micro Center on Amazon, they're, like, 2 bucks a pop, or 32 gigs.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:38:56
So, we don't need a battery anymore? Uh, it says that the battery must be at least 20%, but we're gonna ignore that advice.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:39:03
We're gonna try it in this. Yeah, I mean, if it's plugged into a power supply, then… Well, yeah, you shouldn't need a bed, yeah.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:39:14
I guess it just doesn't want to run out of power in the middle of doing the thing, but it's plugged in.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:39:19
Don't do that. This weekend. I'm glad this weekend is kind of over, because that was a long journey.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:39:27
It's a long freaking training. I thought it was good, but, like.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:39:30
The guy's from, like, Webster, but he moved up to Keene, New York, or Keene Valley.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:39:34
Which is, like, mid… middle of nowhere.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:39:40
He's a little crazy. I'm sad the weekend. Me too. What?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:39:47
I'm… I need to go back, like, a week, and… Yeah, started doing work.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:39:54
I've already hooked up. Er4 plus… I mean, there's still… there's still not a lot of work getting assigned. We'll probably catch up right now.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:40:04
But one of the things that I've independent study. For my master's. So…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:40:11
Yeah, damn. I have worked for that. You know, unfortunately.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:40:23
Hmm, here we go. Oh, that's just an image.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:40:30
Alrighty, where's the SD card slot? That is not the SD card slot.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:40:38
I see card sliding. Sit in the battery compartment?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:40:45
I'll probably just know that, huh? Yep. Oh, that's cool.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:40:51
It's not very well.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:40:59
Let's see… I want to know what they're trying to do on this.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:41:06
Oh! Alright, this is another pie. One of our metrics should be things that we fixed.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:41:12
With the shield on it. I'm gonna write that down. Broken things that we've…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:41:19
So I don't know if I need to write that down. I think AI's writing that down.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:41:23
Ai. One of our metrics should be things that we fixed.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:41:28
Write that down. Okay, yeah, to be fair, we could also write it down.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:41:35
Yeah, we could, somewhere else.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:41:43
Land somewhere near the forest. Okay, I don't think that, like, that it doesn't have a battery. Uh, we can do a meeting notes.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:41:50
Great idea. Like the previous team did. Yeah.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:41:54
Yeah, that's what the AI is. It's meeting notes. It's notes about our transfers. Is there a battery anywhere?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:42:01
We'd be looking for a while. Uh, you know, are you gonna be just not? Should we look for… well, before we buy one, because they're not… Before we used to have some, but they're not weird. Microsd? No, battery, because it's not going to do anything on the battery.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:42:16
How cheap are they, actually? Here, I buy batteries and eBay. Shit. As you said, buy his shit items? They're like…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:42:26
$30-ish. That's not bad. Is that… are they… like, products dependent?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:42:33
The Hero 5 battery, the same as Hero 10? What is… 087654-2018 for $13 in V&H.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:42:41
We've got a model of this is here funny. Okay. Then, yeah, very honest, there you go.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:42:47
That's not my… That's another need. There you go, perfect. Are we 100% sure it's, like, not in the room somewhere? Also, are we 100% sure that if we get that battery, that this is gonna be fully functional?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:43:01
So, it should be a question for the other team. Okay.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:43:07
No. That's why it does that say that. Because if we don't… like, if that's not gonna fix that, then we should probably just get a new camera. We should probably get that for $13 just as easily.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:43:17
Yeah, or we can side… well, I like Hannah instead. Yeah, I mean… I mean, this one's got a webcam, so if… I'm just saying, like, if we wanted to have them be, like, somewhat consistent.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:43:27
It might be easier, yeah. I mean, I agree. I would agree to use a webcam rather than this thing. This thing's actually gonna be more of a pain in the butt to interface with software-wise. Anyway, just get rid of the battery and just… That's probably why they switched, because they were looking for a camera with an API.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:43:44
It says it in their notes. Yeah. These are easier, they're just USB mode, or they're just…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:43:49
Yeah, webcast. It'll need Visa, or there's a piece of the interface with the kernel level.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:43:55
So, anyway.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:44:00
Don't fly with the battery, to be honest. Well, I'm gonna add it, but I'm gonna say that we…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:44:05
Maybe I can just do a different thing. Yeah. Battery or… This year?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:44:14
You guys, uh, see those… PTZ webcams, they're coming out with now? Obs spot, I got one recently.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:44:21
What is it? Obs Spot or, um… I know there's another one. Ever got access to the Git repo? It's just a little headcount Zoom webcam.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:44:32
Wow. Yeah, they're fucking expensive, but maybe I'll bring one in Thursday. Isn't that with this one? Basically, yeah.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:44:40
For Taku or something? No, that's… I bought it for myself, because I was like, oh, that's cool as shit.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:44:44
What are you gonna need to find? It's webcam. Yeah, fair enough. It has those features that this wants, is, like, if you put a sticker on the whiteboard, it'll zoom in a little bit. I even looks ridiculous.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:44:55
Yes. There's a lot more compact of a solution. Of course. Who doesn't? Of course.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:45:06
Uh, what else do I have? I hope it makes the list of the inventory of things you have.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:45:11
I hope the AI does that. Yeah, it's doing that right now.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:45:16
Yeah, what else are we… what are we doing? We got the 4UP, we got the… We got the 4UP, we got students access to the repo… If I go back on that, the other things we could talk about right now are metrics and roles.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:45:32
But ideally, we'd have the scope first, you know? I just shot off the… well, if I get shot off tomorrow morning, but… Or a hard do… I mean, unless you go to the office. What roles are there? I don't mean that. He sent me the emails of the…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:45:49
So, I sent off an email the previous team, you guys will all be copied on it when I get sent out. Yeah. I don't… So if we can… They had for their rules…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:45:59
They didn't have much. It was pretty simple. Yeah, I mean, we don't need to do anything crazy, it'll be very versatile, but…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:46:07
Well, do we… do we want to talk about metrics and roles now, or do we want to wait until we get the scope figured out first, and talk to the other team? We should wait.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:46:14
I think we should wait. I don't think we're at a crucial point where we need to have it done tomorrow. And, like, I just feel like there's so much potential for change in what we actually want to get done. Yeah.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:46:24
Yeah. That, like, it's not really worth talking about yet. And I don't think there's a rush for it, and I don't think it's going to be a super long discussion, either. I don't think so either. I think it's going to be a 10-minute, 15-minute discussion at most. Do we have anything to add to the four up before I do a final run-through?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:46:40
Uh, yeah, I gotcha. Let's see… oh boy, what are we at?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:46:47
Uh… so that's hot. Refill access we got, determined your scope goal…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:46:54
Contact your 24… Yelp, and you guys up. Probably.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:47:00
You can also put team social events up, too. Oh, yeah, yeah. Um… We'd still have to say what we… Team social event?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:47:08
Oh, it's true. I spoke to the ambitious shit, did we?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:47:14
Create a prompt for that. I hate… We'll have this in… it almost confuses me anyway. That would be our solution. Louis and Grady, maybe? Plans with…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:47:27
Plans? Oh, sorry. No, you're good. Standard currency.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:47:33
I want to talk to this so-called documentation. Did I say, Avalon.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:47:40
Yeah. I would bomb in the Pickle fans. I know you're so passionate. What's in A? Na. Like, the grade. Reading through this stuff. We need an A.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:47:55
I like that. I like that. Because now he knows that that's what we want. I'm just gonna say one other thing before we… They said it's too many for a close this so I can figure out how to get… What do you do?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:48:10
I think we should put underneath that we need to contact, like, that we need to get in contact with the previous team.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:48:15
Because, like, everything is being blocked up by that right now, it feels like.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:48:20
That's in the plans. Could it be in both? I don't know. Because we're unclear as when that is, what some of the things they did. Uh, the other thing I want to log in is some of the project website information. Any due dates on that? We'll be on that, um…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:48:39
We need… yeah, we need information. Oh, so I gotta go bother Kaiser again, because he hasn't done that. Um… Done one.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:48:47
Although, I don't know if that really matters. Okay, team rules… So it's due…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:49:02
Tim Rose, let's do the 12th. Upload your day and your first forum.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:49:07
While unavailable. So this is… I'm just gonna… For that show.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:49:15
Why don't we have something to set up, then? Now, all it says is, submit your first agenda and your forum.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:49:21
I just want to reset this guy's Wi-Fi. If you go into the… are you under the team role sponsored Meetings Weekly Forum?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:49:30
Yeah, take view action. Do you already know that. Scroll down.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:49:34
Upload your first agenda in your first forum. Future four-ups, should we… We had an agenda going into it, shall we?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:49:42
We're good. We did. Well, actually, let's submit… Let's submit, because we're going to be getting the Paiser on Thursday. Let's submit that agenda when that meeting? Yeah. So we'll… when… because it's through Friday. So, after a Thursday meeting, we'll go submit that as for this assignment, the rest of them will go on GitHub.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:50:02
Yeah, sounds good. And then we have what we need to for this assignment.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:50:08
Because they're okay. So, before Friday? Imagine R&D. Right. But other than that… What do you think it would take to get this money on the ceiling?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:50:20
Much bureaucracy, right? Yes. I mean… To get what? The robots mounted on the ceiling? Probably just replace the ceiling tile.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:50:28
How heavy are they? That means I guarantee you… Is that worth our time? No, I was just… that was one of the things Mount Gelsky had mentioned. I guarantee Mt. Yeah, I just don't see that happening. What's the worst that happens, like, realistically? What do you mean it falls off the ceiling and domes a dude in the head? Yeah, yeah. If it just…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:50:49
False braids, this is here. To be fair, the EHS director at the time. Although these ceilings can't support much. That's a drop ceiling. Oh, gosh! Yeah, yummy. You think they went out there before?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:51:01
I doubt it. Why would they? Not happening. Now, how much should we thank the robot weighs?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:51:11
More than that. Yeah. More than 40 pounds. More than that's going to support. It supports 40 pads.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:51:20
Roughly. That would just be way more effort than we would ever get. Oh, yeah.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:51:26
It would be cool, but… I mean, it's probably some sort of thing. Some's gonna come in and be like, how that… why is this so much dropshipping on the floor?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:51:35
Reason. It was part of the robot. Uh, I don't think anything else is even open yet for robot Polaroids. Um, the finalization of initial project tools is not due till the 21st, so… Got time. The word of research… So, my SD card back?

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:51:49
What if the robot just came alive? Like, it gained consciousness. We'd have to kill it. So, are we good on meeting, though? I think we're good. Yeah. Notes. So, I'm gonna stop…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:52:01
The transcript, put it all in taxes. I've got to do that shit in the corner over there. Alright, once I stop this transcript, I don't want any… anything else… We don't need to… we can't talk about the thing anymore, because then I gotta start back up. No, we can talk about it a little bit, just can't be…

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:52:15
Like, in detail, like… Scope-wise, we want… I think we're… I think we're done. If you miss anything, it's gonna be something small.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:52:24
Watch, I'm gonna hit pause, and you're just gonna… Oh, yeah, I'm waiting.

[J Russ (RIT Student)] 17:52:34
I mean, yeah, but if we don't have any idea, yeah.
