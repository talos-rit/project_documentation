## MIT
- Anyone can use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software with very few restrictions. 
- The key requirements as a maintainer is that the original copyright notice and the license text must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.
- The maintainers are not legally responsible for any issues, damages, or liabilities arising from the use of the copied code.
## APACHE
- It requires preservation of the original copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices in all copies or substantial portions of the software.
- Modified files must include a notice stating changes have been made.
- There is no obligation to release derivative works under the Apache License or make modified source code public.
- It explicitly grants patent rights from contributors to users, allowing use, sale, and distribution without fear of patent litigation.
- Includes a termination clause that revokes patent rights if a user sues alleging patent infringement related to the software.

## AGPL 3.0
- it grants users freedoms to run, modify, and distribute the software, requiring that any distributed or modified versions remain under AGPL.
- It requires that the complete corresponding source code be made available not only when the software is distributed but also when it is accessed remotely over a network. This means if you modify AGPL-licensed software and run it as a network service, you must provide users of the service access to the modified source code.
- Contributors grant users a worldwide, royalty-free patent license under any essential patents related to the software.
- It requires keeping all copyright and license notices intact and mandates that significant changes be documented.
- It fosters cooperation and sharing improvements in network-deployed software, ensuring user freedoms even when software is not traditionally "distributed."

## GPL v3
- Any distributed modified or original code must include the full license text and copyright notices.
- Source code must be made available when distributing binaries, enabling users to study and further modify the software.
- Modifications must be clearly stated and released under GPLv3, ensuring derivatives remain open source.
- It explicitly grants a worldwide, royalty-free patent license from contributors to users.
- It includes provisions against "tivoization," preventing hardware restrictions that block users from running modified versions of the software.

## Conclusion

MIT is a perfect license for our research project as it allow us to open our software with the most freedom and least responsibility for maintenance of code. This license would allow us to just say "use our code to how ever you please". Meaning professors could use the software and provide services using the software without any restrictions. While Apache is also fine to use, it just adds more overhead from legal standpoint and as long as we aren't heavily managing patents, there is no needing for this license over MIT. GPLv3 would be the next recommendation after MIT as it allows us to ensure all modifications made to our software is also open sourced if that is a priority with our license. The GPL's greatest part is that if our software does require services and hosting software, that section of our application could be licensed with AGPL which is compatible with our GPL licensed software.
