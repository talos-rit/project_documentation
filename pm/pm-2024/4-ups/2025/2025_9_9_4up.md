## Progress:
Repo access!!

Determined major scope goals between the current team
 - 2 Robots, (Bluey and unc) working in tandem collecting video

Completed the social event at Chick Magnet in Rochester

Contancted 2024 team to talk about current status

Named the robots

Decided to continue with "Talos" as the team name

Verified that Unc (the ER V scorbot) works completely

## Risks:

Is our scope too ambtious/unambitious?
 - Can we actually get bluey functional?

Is the base of unc whats causing the random auto e-stops?
 - Will we need to buld a more rigid frame for unc?

## Plans:

Meet with 2024 team to understand the current state and the goals they worked towards

Verify functionality of all current equipment
 - Cameras (specificall the gopro that has BAD? shapried on the front)

Plan the roles and responsobilities

Determine project metrics
