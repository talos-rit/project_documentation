## Key takeaways

- The team is working on various components of their senior project, including ESP drivers, GPIO for encoders, and video streaming
- Several ESP32 devices are experiencing flashing issues, requiring Chinese drivers to resolve
- Team members discussed academic progress, including thesis requirements and independent study options
- Some members are considering career options and job applications after graduation

| Hiroto      | - PC9685 merged in- ESP drivers | - Video streaming with media pipe- Working on buffer problem between frames | - Test Zener/Schottky diodes- Start with GPIO for encoders | - Hardware ADC software                                            |
| Team Member | - DIY1 course                   | - Flashing ESP32 devices- Working on GPIO components                        | - Wi-Fi driver implementation                              | - Chinese driver needed for some ESP32 devices- Low laptop battery |

## High risks

- Several ESP32 devices not functioning properly despite multiple attempts to flash them
- Buffer problem with video streaming causing playback issues
- Team members concerned about thesis requirements and course availability for graduation
