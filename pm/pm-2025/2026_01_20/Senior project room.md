## Key takeaways

- The team decided to prioritize getting Bluey working as their top goal
- Single speaker tracking was identified as the second priority, pending research on feasibility
- The team agreed to use protocol buffers regardless of communication protocol decisions
- gRPC implementation was designated as a stretch goal due to time constraints
- Driver development needs more resources and is critical for project success
- The team will research single speaker tracking feasibility before Thursday's meeting

## High risks

- Single speaker tracking may not be feasible with the team's current expertise
- Limited time remaining in the semester (only January, February, and March left)
- Driver development is behind schedule compared to Commander
- Current sensing and encoder functionality not yet implemented
