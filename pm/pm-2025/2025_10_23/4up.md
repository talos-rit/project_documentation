## Plans:

* Implement Polar Pan in driver to bring bluey 1 to 1 with unc (blocked by hardware)
* Update ICD (most of it is just not accurate)
* implement data return flow from operator
* multi camera in operator (currently connection manager does not interface)
* director input of position from operator (needs data return flow)
* operator return flow
* Multi-robot config enhancement
