## Progress:
- Successfully read ADS chip
* Registered for Imagine
* Research around speed of Pi/MCP23017 over I2C (max 1khz at 400khz I2C)
* Created project for ESP code, which will run the motor drivers
* Decided on full scope for this milestone
* PyAV implementation for pulling video frames over network
- Commander single speaker (biggest box method)

## Risks:
* ESP Requires Hardware redevelopment. Can introduce risks, will it fully work.
	* Going to continue with ESP over STM for now due to member skills and experience

## Plans:
* Re-implement driver on an ESP
* Write setup documentation and simplifying user experience(webserial deployment on github pages maybe??) on ESP. Installing the whole tool-chain is complicated
* Redo all hardware again for esp
* Onboard everyone to ESP development
* Fix ADC signals
* Operator config refactor (use actual YAML parser)
* Conan dependency management integrations
* Stream video footage out of Commander

## Needs:

* None right now
