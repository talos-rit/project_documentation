## Progress:
- PCA9685 driver ported to ESP, in review
- Figured out way to calibrate current sense
- Commander WebRTC feature in review
- 

## Risks:
* ESP Requires Hardware redevelopment. Can introduce risks, will it fully work.

## Plans:
* Re-implement driver on an ESP
* Write setup documentation and simplifying user experience(webserial deployment on github pages maybe??) on ESP. Installing the whole tool-chain is complicated
* Redo all hardware again for esp
* Onboard everyone to ESP development
* Stream video footage out of Commander
* YOLO + Mediapipe refactor
* Config/argparser for commander

## Needs:

* None right now
