## Progress:
1. PCA9685 driver ported to ESP, in review
2. Figured out way to calibrate current sense
3. Commander WebRTC feature in review

## Risks:
1. ESP Requires Hardware redevelopment. Can introduce risks, will it fully work.

## Plans:
1. Re-implement driver on an ESP
2. Write setup documentation and simplifying user experience(webserial deployment on github pages maybe??) on ESP. Installing the whole tool-chain is complicated
3. Redo all hardware again for ESP
4. Onboard everyone to ESP development
5. Stream video footage out of Commander
6. YOLO + Mediapipe refactor
7. Config/argparser for commander

## Needs:
1. Get more esp for each dev
