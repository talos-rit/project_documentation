## Key takeaways

- The team has made significant progress with the robot now able to move, though some components like current sensing still need work
- The MCP expander is fully implemented using I2C, with only interrupt checking remaining
- Multiple connections epic is complete
- The team will participate in Maker Faire on Saturday and has organized staffing schedule
- A grad student has expressed interest in working on a digital twin/simulation for the project
- The team plans to host an internal demo
