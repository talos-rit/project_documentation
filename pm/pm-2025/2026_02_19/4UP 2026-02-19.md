## Progress:
1. Opted out of using i2cdev driver, ADC will be implemented using i2c_master_bus esp lib
2. Swapped to ESP32 instead of S3, as it has the number of PCNT channels we need
3. Commander config refactor- in review
4. Finalized architecture for commander
5. Started refactoring Director code
6. Wifi driver implemented, socket mostly implemented, just need processing
7. Unit test framework for ESP merged
8. PCNT library is complete and will be going through unit tests

## Risks:
1. ESP Requires Hardware redevelopment. Can introduce risks, will it fully work.

## Plans:
1. Re-implement driver on an ESP (in progress)
2. ADS1015 - in progress
3. PCNT - in progress
4. Wifi + Socket - Wifi and socket work, but wifi won't connect to wpa3, and disconnects after first flash(now works!)
5. Write setup documentation and simplifying user experience(webserial deployment on github pages maybe??) on ESP. Installing the whole tool-chain is complicated
6. Redo all hardware again for ESP
7. YOLO + Mediapipe refactor
8. argparser for commander?

## Needs:
1. Get more esp for each dev
