## Progress:

* Verified that Unc (the ER V scorbot) works completely over serial
* Bluey does function on all axis with the driver (or Ichor).
* Met with previous team
* Put board on unc

## Risks:

Is our scope too ambitious/unambitious?

## Plans:

Verify functionality of all current equipment
 - Check rest of bluey's axis to ensure functionality

Plan the roles and responsibilities

Determine project metrics
 - Metric for amount of things that we've fixed

Divy out tasks

## Needs:

New motor driver board, current one of the drivers on the current board is burnt
Oscilliscope (I don't think it's in the room yet)
