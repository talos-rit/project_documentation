# Meeting Notes
Last minute 

## Todo: 
- submit late presentation
    - ^ this might have cost us the awards :/
- finish the Hand-off docs
    - add the tech doc to the repo / total hand-off docs
- 

## Feedback
- tech doc was BS-ing a little (metrics, early process)
- final presentation was submitted late
- missing peer-evals and course evals in the dashboard (just the initials tho)
- peer evals
    - nothing too outstanding or obvious
    - alex made a come back :D
    - brooke fell from grace
- presentation feedback
    GOOD
    - fun, interactive demo
    - good explainations of the computer vision stuff and hardware
    BAD
    - demo kinds went off the rails
    - not enough explaination into computer vision stuff
- coach & sponsor at the same time was difficult. Little actual coaching was done

## Ideas for the future
- research project
    - have a thesis-defense style final presentation with sponsors (who will be a few RIT professors) where the students can go into detail about the technical research that was done on the project. 
    - the focus should be more on the results of the research rather than features
    - coach who has experience runnign research teams
- team size
    - 6 was too many, 4 could be a better size
