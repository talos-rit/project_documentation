## Key takeaways

- The team's main goal is to get two robots (Unc and Bluey) with cameras working together to track subjects simultaneously
- Bluey needs significant repairs as it currently has non-functional motors and encoders
- The team needs to contact Brooke from the previous team to understand what was accomplished and what issues remain
- The team established a tentative scope with priority on getting Bluey functional first
- Potential stretch goals include improved camera framing, slow shots, and sound-based subject detection
## Team updates

No formal updates were provided as this appears to be an initial planning meeting.
## High risks

- Bluey may require extensive repairs that could be beyond the scope of a senior project
- The team lacks complete information about the previous team's accomplishments and technical details
- Taking apart the functional robot (Unc) to fix Bluey could risk having no working robots
