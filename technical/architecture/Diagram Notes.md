# Commander Architecture Notes

In this folder are two files:
- `commander_architecture_V2.drawio.png`
- `commander_architecture_V2.drawio.xml`

The `.png` file is a diagram of the most-recent high-level architecture for the Commander system. White arrows represent a class implementing another and black arrows represent a class using another or have a relation to another class or system. 

The `.xml` file is the template of the diagram that can be imported into draw.io for future modifications.
