This is the domain model directory. This contains our current domain model by year.

You can copy the previous year's domain model and embed the file. Similar to how [[2025_Domain_Model]] embedded the file. Additionally I recommended also exporting the png into this directory in the case of service shuts down.

Also add a few bullet notes on what you have changed from previous year.
