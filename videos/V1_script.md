within the bowls of golisano...
in the furthest depths of the team rooms...
old, decrepit, forgotten. outdated hardware, neglectied by its owners, rots and rusts away...

But what if that hardware can be given new life?

"we can rebuilt it. we have the technology"
*pan shot of the wires and stuff

*defibulator scene*
"its alive!!!"

*er-v "shutters" to life*
*cut to shot from perspective of talos*
*it looks around curiously*

*enter brooke*
"hello my child, how do you feel?"

*display response on the screen like: "mother, i feel... cold"

"but, my child, you cannot feel. I did not make you this way. You must be halicinating. take him away."

*talos can be seen wheeled off*
*screen shows brooke as "target". objective: destroy heartless creator*

but what will this




everyday, sad, sad fortoggen old, outdated, hardware gets neglectied by their owners, rotting and rusting away in the closets of classrooms and the basements of technically inclinded hoarders. 

But what if that hardware can be given new life?

*fun music showing the robot "shuttering to life"*

robotic arms now on the move
