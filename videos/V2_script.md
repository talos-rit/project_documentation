## Final Script

(shots of scorbot fidgetting)
does your robot get anxious easily?
does it fidget?
stutter its motors?
(shot of scorbot moving back and forth, unable to choose a target)
does it struggle to make up its mind about who it wants to target... i mean... track?

(jounior engineer on lab table talking to principle engineer, who is taking notes)
(like a patient talking to a doctor)
Talk to your principle engineer today about **Talos** (name appears on screen?)
(shot of talos moving smoothly with a happy jounior engineer)
The newest in robotic rejuvination technology that can breath new life into that old bucket of bolts. 

(show scorebot tracking and following, including single speaker)
With the power of advanced computer visison technology, your robot can tracks its friends and focus on only one with just a simple gesture. 

(close up of hardware, zoom out to manual interface moving scorbot quickly)
Along with its custom controller module, **Talos** can bypass the mundane slog of old interfaces and directly control every moving part of the robot. 

(shot of engineer being interviewed)
Before, I thought my robot would be slow and dumb forever. 
But with **Talos**, I have the confidence to bow before our future overlords. 

(slow pan over the scorbot with engineers laughing)     [read this quickly for comedic effect]
Side effects of **Talos** on your robot may include:
- idle mode
- desk mode
- itching
- scratching
- heiroglyphic error logs
- dellusions of world domination
- judgement day

(engineers high-five then dance as camera blurs) (add logo here again?)
Talk to your principle engineer today about **Talos**
Ditch the past, but not the hardware


## Notes
Answer: "What are the results of our project?"

- core functions
- core features
    > be honest about what we actually have done so far and how we expect the project to continue in the future
    - move and follow
    - detect multiple subjects, but track the primary subject
    - 


- future work
    - idle animations
    - moving down to look around an object on a table
    - its brother can move too!
    
- outro
    - see you all at Imagine!


early 2000s ADHD commerical


We put our bestest, cheapest, most over caffinated sleep-deprived burntout former gifted-kid interns on it. 
With the power of advanced computer visison technology, your robot can tracks its adversa-- its friends with ease... and keep them LOCKED IN. 
Bypassing the mundane slog of old interfaces, Talos, along with its custom controller addon, can seemlessly control every moving part of the ScorBot. 

- a building ressentment for linux
- a mounting frustration for python
- a monumental hatred for ActiveMQ



target aquired from when the subject makes the x-pose

from closet to lab to classroom, Talos as grown to a fully grown almost functioning member of robot society. 
He can look around and track his friends, and even knows how to pay attention to the important ones in frame. 

Soon, he will be able to move gently in place, swaying in the breeze like a soft stalk of wheat. 
And be able to look down at a table, observing objects below him all angles

In more exciting news, with the power of electro-embedded necromany, Talos's brother has been resurrected from the grave. 
So we are excited to see what the next team of mad-scientist engineers will do with two cameras instead of just one. 

Our project will be exhibited at Imagine RIT, hope to see you all there!
