every day, professors cast aside outdated technology that was once cool back in the 80s like they were. 

Abondoned to rust away and collect dust in dark closets, this technology is ignored and forgotten. 

But, what if there was another way?
A way to breathe new life into old tech?
With ingenuity, commitment, and teamwork...
Through a revitalization effort of Scorbot ER-V...
Team Talos presents... the automated cameraperson!

Using advanced computer vision models and modern software design, 
the automated cameraperson was trained rigorously to follow its target to keep them in frame. 
To ensure the compliance to human orders, ethical authorities have  trained the automated cameraperson in the arts of what it means to be a good robot in a human world. 

Wow your fellow faculty and show-off to your friends the power artifical intelligence pumped through the motors of old tech. 
Just be careful it doesn't grow resentful...
