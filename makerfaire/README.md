## Maker Faire

Maker Faire is a similar exhibit style event at as Imagine RIT with more focus on engineering and makers space that has a few members coming from outside of the RIT organization. This event is in the fall semester around mid-November.

This event is really good for getting a practice at demoing our project and getting used to talking about this capstone project.
