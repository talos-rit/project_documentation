This research project seeks to repurpose the ScorBot ER-4pc and ER-V, an educational robotic arm, into an autonomous robotic cameraperson. While basic videography techniques are well understood, capturing high-quality footage in dynamic environments like classrooms or live presentations requires constant operator attention. The project's goal is to automate camera operations—such as panning, tilting, zooming, and framing subjects—to create more engaging recordings. This project includes the ideation, research, and development of software that integrates machine learning, computer vision, and other technologies to guide camera movements. The previous iteration of this project completed the full control of the ER-V with a basic tracking algorithm and a basic driver for starting to control the ER-4pc without its original controller. Our scope plans to further the research by completing the functionality of the ER-4pc and refactoring the controller to interface with both robots simultaneously. We will also be modifying the algorithm to use better framing and videography techniques, as well as working with both camera angles to swap between. Additionally, we plan to refactor existing code in order to increase the maintainability of the system.
