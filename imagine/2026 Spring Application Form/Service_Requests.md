There will be a local WiFi router supplied by us that will be used to connect all of our devices in a predictable networked environment. This does not require internet access and will never be connected to the RIT network. If an internet access is required for one of our laptops, the devices will be disconnected from our intranet network to guarantee isolation. 
We also require semi large space(at least two table size space) for our robots to operate in its full non-overlapping operational range of estimated one table size and an additional table space for displaying our live video footage and extra artifacts from our project.
