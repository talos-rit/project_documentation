This is the directory for all of the previous and current imagine RIT.

## Info
Usually Imagine RIT is done at the end of the spring semester and the deadlines for the applications are around March, but it can be submitted way ahead of time. There are also earlier deadlines for the SHED and Gordon Field House, so please be cautious of any deadlines. Also note that this could change yearly, so please go to the [imagine RIT event link](https://www.rit.edu/imagine/proposal) for accurate information.
