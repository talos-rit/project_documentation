Research Questions
- How many cameras should be mounted on the arm? - John
- Look up the capabilities of a GoPro Hero 6 - Nolan
- how necessary is a second camera for the MVP? (Should we do one or two)
- think about finding a camera with a solid API to control it. (not a priority) - Brooke
- deciding what kind of hardware / computer we want to use (raspi?) Zima blade could be considered - Noah

General Notes
- for MVP:
	Focus is for video storage locally, not streaming
	Keep the subject in the center of the frame
	decided on a camera storing footage locally
	AI is responsible for only tracking
	Need to do more research to decide on 1 vs 2 cameras
	Decided on no need to zoom or focus
	No preset camera locations (only one preset config)
