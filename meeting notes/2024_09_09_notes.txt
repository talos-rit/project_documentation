2024_09_09 Talos Notes

Technical:
- Mkdocs for hosting documentation
- Github Issues for issue tracking
- Arm interface controller hardware considerations:
	- RPI 4 (good ports: usb, ethernet, wifi/bt)
		- Pros:
			- Lots of ports
				- USB
				- Ethernet
				- Wifi
				- Bluetooth
			- Easily program in any language (including python)
			- Can multitask
		- Cons:
			- Expensive
			- Hard to source
			- Overkill
	- ESP32
		- Pros:
			- Cheap
			- Easy to aquire
			- Well suited performance for the work load
			- Bare-metal (low power, direct control)
			- Bluetooth
			- Wifi
		- Cons:
			- Can't mutlitask
			- Few (if any) accessible ports

- Camera considerations:
	- 2 Camera solution:
		- Easier to handle high resolution video stream
		- Less complex video processing
		- Tracking alogrithm has to guess what is actually being captured (difficult to syncronize zoom/focus/offset)
	- 1 Camera solution:
		- Have to figure out how to handle high resoultion streams
		- Tracking alogrithm can see exactly what is being captured
		- More complex video processing
		
Process:
- AI/ML expert: John
- Embedded expert: Brooke
- (Tentative) Process person: Alex (Nolan as backup)
- Communication person: [Same as Process Person]
- Dedicated diagrammer: Nolan

Goals:
- Concretely define requirements and MVP; Scope creep *will* be a recurring issue to manage.
- Get a white board
