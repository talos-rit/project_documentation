Team roles: 
- feel out the roles as we work on the stuff
- Communications (comm with sponsor and backlog management)
	- Noah
	

Duties: 
- anal repo guy
- clean the room


Organize the tasks: 
- ideas: 
	- subteams have their own plans
	- one huge backlog for the plan
- hardware: 
	- Brooke's cameras
	- start cheap, work up from there
	- Lab machine? (we need to decide if its necessary)
Cameras: 
- how many (2, 3?)
	- 3 cameras
		- 2 bots and wide field of view cam to see the whole room
		- wide view cam as backup to bots
		- wide view cam as default for AI to fallback on if robots don't know that to focus on
	- Meta data
		- confidence intervals for each camera feed

	- up to 3 data steams with TONS of meta data

- each camera has its own control vs overhead controller for all cameras
- Live vs post-processing (strentch goal)
	- AI controls which stream to capture (destructive editing)
		- low skill user
		- loss of event recording
		- live processing
	- AI gives user suggestions based on all footage coming in (not as wanted)
		- high skill user
		- post-processing

Overall process: 
- dont get hungup on stuff. STUB IT OUT! (then come back and make it work)
- work for a week or 2, then do a retrospective on ideas (both brainstorming and idea trimming)
- researching 
	- defining hardware requirements
	- domain model and high-level architecture
	- interface brainstorming


Problems: 
- will people actually be able to use 3 cameras
- cameras are loud (separate audio source)
	- active noise cancelling(???)
	- run at low speeds?
- start with 1 robot 1 camera

Architecting for the future
- abstracting away the camera controls
	- swap the robtos for later
4-up
